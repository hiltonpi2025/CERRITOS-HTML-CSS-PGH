<h1>Peter G. Hilton</h1>
<p>I am Peter G. Hilton. and attending Cerritos College taking HTML 5 and CSS to brush up on my coding skills. I intend to use the information I learn and very excited taking this class and will use it to update my business web site. I am originally from England and a citizen of the US. I work for the City of Los Angeles in Engineering and have a "Design Technology degree"  which I obtained from Cerritos College. I also run my own Security Training School and have been a Licensed Private investigator for 40 years. I am married and have three children who are of "Cherokee Indian" heritage, which I amn very proud of. </p>
